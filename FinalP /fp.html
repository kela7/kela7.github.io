If your goal coming here was to find a plan that challenges you in every way, then you've found it. After you squat every day, everything else will seem easy.</p>

    							<p class ="title1">SQUAT EVERY DAY PROGRAM</p>
    							<p class="p">Most people try to squat once per week. And by "try," I mean I see guys squatting a quarter of the way down, skipping sets, and doing more talking than actual work. I built this trainer on the premise that, every single day, you're going to shut up and you're going to squat.</p>

    							<p class="p">You're not doing leg press or Smith machine squats. You're putting actual weight on an actual barbell and you're free squatting. That's how this program works. It might sound crazy, but it's meant to be hard. There is no "easy" mode. Make it tough and reap the rewards.</p>
    							<img src= "https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/12341472_10153228714958016_7820820100893196971_n.jpg?oh=a46c3ffa112ae1aa48f9aca8c547a4f2&oe=56F7DAFE">
    							<p class="p">If you're a gym novice or simply worried that you can't handle daily squats, toss that worry aside. "I had three different kids at three different levels start this program at the same time," says Broz. "One year later, they all made identical gains. They all went up almost 200 pounds in their squat in a year. So, no matter where you start, you can make progress. Nobody has a monopoly on strength. Everybody can get stronger."</p>

    							<p class="p">Over the next 30 days, you'll learn and do 11 squat variations. So, each day you'll squat a little differently, testing yourself under slightly different loads and patterns. No matter what variation you do, though, you need to bring your very best effort to the rack. Anything less would be disrespectful.erfect right away. Take your time and get to know your body as you move forward.</p>

    			<h2>Nutriton/Supplements</h2>
    			<p>The Squat Every Day nutrition plan gives you the opportunity to choose whether you want to build muscle or carve a leaner physique. The training program will stay the same, but you'll alter your daily food and supplement program to support either goal. If you're training primarily for strength gains, I'd go with the muscle-building plan.</p>

    							<p class ="title1">SQUAT EVERY DAY NUTRITION PROGRAMS</p>
    							<p class="p">If you're accustomed to seeing a bodybuilder-style program, the calories for each of these plans may seem high. However, it's worth repeating that the amount of work you're going to do in the gym is going to require a lot of food, so don't be afraid of the almighty calorie.</p>

    							<p class="p">Of course, if you have a lot of weight to lose, or if you're a relatively light female, you may need to dip below the calorie totals listed below. But don't eat less than 1700 calories per day. Given the amount of work in this trainer, that's the lower limit I'd recommend. In fact, I maintain my physique and strength at about 3,000 calories, but that may not work for you.</p>
    							<img src= "http://images.askmen.com/news/sports/forget-calorie-counting-eat-this-much-website-tells-you-exactly-what-to-eat_1432124228.jpg">
    							<p class="p">If you're unsure of where to start, choose a calorie and macronutrient total and test it out for a couple for weeks. If you're feeling exhausted, have constant and debilitating soreness, or are losing more than two pounds per week, you're not eating enough. If, on the other hand, you're on the fat-loss plan and notice that the scale isn't moving in the right direction, you may be eating too much.</p>

    							<p class="p">Starting a new nutrition and supplement program can take a little time and experimentation to get right. Don't stress about getting it perfect right away. Take your time and get to know your body as you move forward.</p>

    			<h2>Variations</h2>
    			<p class="p">Each squat variation will feel a little different and will challenge you in a different way. After going through each of them for 30 days, your form will be better and you'll be stronger in every part of the lift. Your muscles will know exactly how to fire so you can move more weight than you ever have.</p>

    						</div>
    						<div class="modal-body3">
    							<p class="p">As you progress through Squat Every Day, you'll notice that some variations challenge you more than others. You have to go after those variations specifically, rather than avoiding them. If one particular variation exposes your weakness, you can't be a wuss and skip it. Do all the work, and your overall squat game will be unbeatable.</p>

    							<p class="title1">SQUAT EVERY DAY SQUAT VARIATIONS</p> 
    							<p class="p">Note: Each time you come around to a particular squat variation, you should try to do more weight than you did the time before. So, if you hit 250 the first time you attempted a front squat, then you know you need to go for 255 or even 260 the next time, depending on how that first successful attempt felt.</p>

    							<p class="title1">VARIATION 1 CLOSE-STANCE DEEP SQUAT</p>
    							<p class="p">The close-stance deep squat is the most basic squat variation you'll perform. It's an Olympic-style squat, so the bar will sit right on top of your traps, and you'll squat until your hip crease falls beneath your knee caps.</p>

    							<p class="p">When you remove the bar from the rack, move your feet so they are about shoulder-width apart, and squeeze your shoulder blades together. Keep your core tight by pushing your abs out and down. As you squat, keep your knees out toward your pinky toes. Explode out of the hole with speed.</p>

    							<img src="https://scontent-lga3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/12278800_10153225829583016_7752522665014511275_n.jpg?oh=31b5b6b196f88f31071322ed064c0b9c&oe=56DB8F17">
    							<p class="p">When you use a belt, wear it correctly. The belt should be very tight, and should be worn around your torso at the belly button, not down at your waist. Use the rack to help pull your belt as tight as possible.</p>

    							<p class="title1">VARIATION 2 FRONT SQUAT</p>
    							<p class="p">Having the bar in the front rack position can be difficult for a lot of people. Without the necessary shoulder and wrist mobility, it can be impossible to put the bar on your shoulders with your elbows pointing out.</p>

    							<p class="title1">VARIATION 3 WIDE-STANCE SQUAT</p>
    							<p class="p">This powerlifting-style squat may feel a little weird at first, but you should be able to move more weight because you're going through a shorter range of motion.</p>

    							<p class="title1">SQUAT TILL YOU GROW</p>
    							<p class="p">Now that you're familiar with some of the types of squats you're going to perform throughout Squat Every Day, check out the other overview pages—if you haven't already—and get ready to find out who you really are. This is your hardcore.</p>

Write down what you squat today and keep that number in the back of your mind. Do the same for each squat variation you do throughout the trainer. It should be your goal to squat more weight each week. If you do the program as it's designed, you'll see a much better squat number than you started with.</p>

<p class="container_p1">After you squat, you'll move to some conditioning work. After that, you'll do a push workout to hit your chest and triceps. It's a lot to get through in one workout, but if you don't waste time talking or resting you'll get through it within 90 minutes.</p>
